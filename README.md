# PlotSample

Simple example of a website made using John Sundell's excellent [Plot](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot) & [Files](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Files) libraries, to demonstrate building a **_very_** simple static page using Swift / SPM.

Since this repo has been made, [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) has been published, which is much easier to use for this purpose.

## Usage

```
$ swift build
$ swift run
```

The HTML page is written out to `html`.

## Purpose

This was originally written as a proof of concept demonstarting [the addition of Swift to the Netlify Build Image](https://github.com/netlify/build-image/pull/364).
