# PlotSample

Simple example of a website made using John Sundell's excellent [Plot](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot) & [Files](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Files) libraries, to demonstrate building a **_very_** simple static page using Swift / SPM.

## Usage

```
$ swift build
$ swift run
```

The HTML page is written out to `html`.
